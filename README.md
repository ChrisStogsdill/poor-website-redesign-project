# poor-website-redesign-project

In this Project I will be finding a website that is outdated and using bootstrap to make it more modern. 
Improving the look as well as giving it mobile responsive behavior.

The website I will be using - 
https://www.oklahomacitychinahouse.com/


I imported a google font for use.

I imported font awesome in order to use their icon library. 

I added mobile responsiveness to the site as it had none. 

I added most of the site content to the main page instead of having it spread over several pages.
